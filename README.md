Machine Learning Technologies Examples in .NET Enviroment

Projects:

1. ML_NET_EXAMPLE - ML.NET 1.5 preview 2, uses CPU
2. ML_NET_EXAMPLE_GPU - uses scisharp.tensorflow.redist-windows-gpu, but there is also linux version just switch nuget package.
   And this will require that You install additional software from NVidia for ML, before tensorflow can access your GPU.
3. MNIST_Numsharp_CPU - basic MNIST example without optimization and regularization
